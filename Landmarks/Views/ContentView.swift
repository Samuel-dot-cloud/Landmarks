Located at the foothills of a mountain covered of pines, this rocky formation is incontestably a photo opportunity while you‚Äôre on the road for Terelj. There, it‚Äôs possible to rent horses, and during the summer, you can also find souvenirs‚Äô sellers. It‚Äôs a good starting point for a small walk (about one hour) that will lead you until the centre of meditation of Aryaval or in the most remote places of the park.")
